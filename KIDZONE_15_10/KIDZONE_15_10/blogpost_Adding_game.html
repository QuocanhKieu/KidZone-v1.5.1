                <p>Games are a great way to add some educational fun into yourclassroom instruction. Through educational
                    games students can explore important concepts and take risks in a supportive environment. As a
                    result, they gain confidence in their knowledge and get excited about learning!</p>
                <p>In the classroom, games are a fun way to introduce students to new topics, reinforce content from
                    previous classes, or add a break between more lecture-heavy lessons. Read on for some of our
                    favorite ways to incorporate games into your classroom.</p>
                <h2 style="color: #00a39b;">1. Choose games that match your curriculum</h2>
                <p>Students love having the chance to play a game in class, but you know what makes learning games even
                    better? When they’re aligned to your standards! On Kids-Zone, you can find games for K-6th grade
                    aligned
                    to the Common Core and Next Generation Science Standards.</p>
                <p>These games cover a variety of topics, ranging from early reading and writing foundation skills to
                    middle school statistics and probability. Building these games into your lesson plans provides
                    students the opportunity to practice relevant concepts and develop their understanding of class
                    topics while they play!</p>
                <p>Check out the full list of standards aligned games and printables.</p>
                <h2 style="color: #00a39b;">2. Use games as a bell ringer or reward</h2>
                <p>An easy way to introduce games into your lesson plans is to use them at the beginning or end of class
                    as a bell ringer or to reward early finishers.</p>
                <p>As a bell ringer, games can serve as a fun introduction to that day’s topic or a helpful review of
                    the day before. And as a reward for early finishers, games are a way to celebrate students' hard
                    work in class while keeping them engaged with classroom instruction.</p>
                <p>Take a look at some of our favorite games to use as bell ringers and early finishers!</p>
                <h2 style="color: #00a39b;">3. Play games together as a class</h2>
                <p>Another way to use games in your instruction is to play them as a class. When you play games together
                    with your students, it encourages increased participation while providing you with the opportunity
                    to correct misconceptions in real time. Students also get the chance to work together to problem
                    solve and learn from each other as they play!</p>
                <p>Read our recommendations on games to play as a class.</p>
                <h2 style="color: #00a39b;">4. Add games to themed lessons</h2>
                <p>One way to make instruction more fun is to make it themed! There are plenty of holidays and events
                    happening throughout the year that teachers can use as inspiration to spice up their lesson plans.
                    And, we have plenty of topical games that can tie in perfectly to those plans!</p>
                <p>On Kids-Zone, you can find games for lessons on:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><u>National STEAM Day</u></li>

                    <li><u>Financial Literacy month</u></li>
                    <li><u>New Year’s Eve</u></li>

                    <li><u>Halloween</u></li>
                    <li><u>Thanksgiving</u></li>
                    <li><u>Christmas and Hanukkah</u></li>
                </ul>
                <h2 style="color: #00a39b;">5. Extend learning during school breaks</h2>
                <p>And finally, a great way to use educational games is to assign them over school breaks. Games help
                    your students keep their knowledge sharp and continue learning, just by playing!</p>
                <p>Get inspired by our selection of games that take students on a trip around the world for summer
                    vacation, level-up their summer reading skills, or help them stay warm for winter break.</p>
