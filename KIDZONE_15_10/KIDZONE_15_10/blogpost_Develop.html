                <p>It’s never too early to start teaching your learner all about smart money management—starting with
                    the monetary values and names of U.S. currency! We’ve collected our favorite money-minded games on
                    Kids-Zone to help you introduce or review the concept of currency to your child.</p>
                <p>It just makes cents! Learn about Kids-Zone’s money games:</p>
                <h2 style="color: #00a39b;"><u>Break the Bank - Counting and Sorting</u></h2>
                <p>Despite the name, this game doesn’t cost a thing! But you will have to break open some piggy banks to
                    play. Break the Bank teaches learners the names, values, and presidential portraits associated with
                    U.S. coins and bills. To play, your learner will start by smashing open a piggy bank and counting or
                    sorting the money inside!</p>
                <p>In the Break the Bank - Counting, students will have to correctly count the amount of money on their
                    screen four times to unlock a cash grab game. In Break the Bank - Sorting, learners will have to
                    sort each coin or bill into their correct values at the bottom of the screen. Once they successfully
                    count or sort all the money, they’ll have a chance to collect as many falling coins as possible in
                    their piggy bank.</p>
                <h2 style="color: #00a39b;"><u>Learn to Count Money</u></h2>
                <p>Practice making exact change in this undersea treasure hunt! To play, your learner will click and
                    drag coins and bills into their treasure chest.</p>
                <p>Learners can adjust the game difficulty in order to customize the game to their learning level. In
                    beginner mode, students can use as many coins or bills as they’d like to reach the specified amount
                    of money. In expert mode, they’ll have to use the least number of coins and bills to reach the
                    total.</p>
                <p>The underwater theme makes this game extra fun. For every amount your learner gets correct, they’ll
                    earn one fish. Once they earn 10 fish, they can move on to the next level. But beware, for every
                    question they answer incorrectly, they’ll lose a fish. Students will love building up their own
                    personal aquarium filled with treasure!</p>
                <h2 style="color: #00a39b;"><u>Money BINGO</u></h2>
                <p>Play the classic game of BINGO with a monetary twist. In Money BINGO, your learner will be shown
                    different combinations of coins and bills, and practice counting them up and selecting the correct
                    amount of money. Students are able to customize which coins and bills are used as well as the board
                    size to allow for more personalized practice. For every BINGO your learner earns, they’ll receive a
                    new BINGO bug! Great for students in first through fifth grade, who will be excited to complete
                    their BINGO bug collection.</p>
                <h2 style="color: #00a39b;"><u>Dolphin Dash - Counting Money</u></h2>
                <p>Race to the finish line in this mad dash to complete multiple choice problems. Dolphin Dash -
                    Counting Money is a multiplayer race that measures the accuracy and speed at which students can
                    identify the value of groups of coins. Learners can play alone against the computer, or start an
                    online race with friends or classmates to see who can answer the most money questions the fastest.
                </p>
                <p>To play, students will be shown a couple of coins and can choose the correct value from multiple
                    choice answers. At the end of the race, students can review how accurately and quickly they
                    answered, and which coins they should review more. Second through fourth graders will love racing
                    against their friends to see who comes out on top!</p>
