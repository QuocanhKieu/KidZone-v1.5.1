                <p>Want to increase class participation? Try playing a game!</p>
                <p>We’ve picked out some of the best Kids-Zone games that the whole class can play, either on an
                    interactive
                    whiteboard or by projecting from a computer screen. Whether you’re reviewing an old topic or
                    introducing a new one, students will love to take charge and show off their knowledge!</p>
                <p>Read on for the best games to play as a group:</p>
                <h2 style="color: #00a39b;"><u>Learn to Tell Time</u></h2>
                <p>Teach your students to tell time with giant interactive clocks! Great for early learners, your class
                    will review hours, minutes, AM, and PM on either an analog or a digital clock. Students will love
                    coming up to the board to drag the minute hand around, or click up and down to set the clock to the
                    right time.</p>
                <p>Learn to Tell Time increases in difficulty through four stages, starting with telling time by the
                    hour. And, with 10 different prompts per stage, all your students will have the opportunity to
                    participate!</p>
                <h2 style="color: #00a39b;"><u>Seasonal Shuffle</u></h2>
                <p>Put the calendar months in order with Seasonal Shuffle. In this game, pre-kindergarten through second
                    grade students will learn the order of the months, which season they belong to, and the biggest
                    holidays associated with each month. To make it an engaging class activity, have your students come
                    up one by one to put a month or holiday in the correct order.</p>
                <h2 style="color: #00a39b;"><u>Out of Sight Words</u></h2>
                <p>Practice recognizing sight words with a giant game of I Spy! Through 10 colorful illustrated puzzles,
                    learners will practice matching words from the Dolch Word List to their corresponding images. The
                    Dolch Sight Words are a list of 220 English words that children can learn to recognize on sight.
                    This early reading game is great for learners in kindergarten through third grade. Your class will
                    have so much fun picking out which puzzles to solve and finding each word!</p>
                <h2 style="color: #00a39b;"><u>Submarine Spelling Practice</u></h2>
                <p>Let students show off their spelling abilities in Submarine Spelling Practice! In this game, learners
                    will practice spelling pre-kindergarten through third grade level Dolch Sight Words. Include your
                    whole class by having students take turns dragging and dropping letters into the correct order. Make
                    sure your sound is on so learners can hear the word they’re trying to spell!</p>
                <h2 style="color: #00a39b;"><u>Get in Shape - Geometry</u></h2>
                <p>Help your class get used to recognizing geometric shapes within real-life scenes! This fun twist on
                    an I Spy game reinforces the basics of geometry by connecting concepts to real-life examples. Plus,
                    the three-dimensional aspect allows you to explain complex shapes, like triangular prisms, by
                    breaking them into easier to understand two-dimensional parts. With over 80 shapes to find, all of
                    your students will get a chance to play!</p>
                <h2 style="color: #00a39b;"><u>Orbital Order</u></h2>
                <p>Learn about the solar system in this out-of-this-world trivia game! Orbital Order is a great
                    opportunity for students to work together in teams to demonstrate their understanding of each planet
                    in the solar system and the sun.</p>
                <p>If they answer three questions about a planet correctly, they’ll be able to place it in its correct
                    order in the solar system. Perfect for students in fourth through sixth grade, this game would make
                    a great end-of-unit review, or a fun introduction to facts about outer space!</p>
