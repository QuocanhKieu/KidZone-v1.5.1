                <p>Is your young learner looking to dive into the world of music? Try playing Kids-Zone’s music games!
                    These
                    colorful and interactive games will teach your learner about different musical instruments, how to
                    read notes on a staff, and much more!</p>
                <p>Ready to make some music? Read about a few of our favorite musical games below:</p>
                <h2 style="color: #00a39b;"><u>Bandemonium</u></h2>
                <p>Introduce your student to different instruments! Through three different game modes, your learner can
                    explore the categories of instruments, sort them by type, and make some music of their own! Perfect
                    for students in Kindergarten through 5th grade, Bandemonium will demonstrate the five categories of
                    instruments and share the characteristics of each one. Then, your learner can put it all together
                    and form their own virtual band!</p>
                <h2 style="color: #00a39b;"><u>Taking Notes - Rhythm and Pitch</u></h2>
                <p>Is your learner ready for sheet music? Taking Notes - Rhythm and Pitch is great for students in 3rd
                    through 6th grade. It will teach them how to read the different types of notes and rests, as well as
                    the names of each pitch on a treble clef scale.</p>
                <p>First, your student will choose either Rhythm or Pitch to learn about, and interactive explanations
                    will guide your learner through the topic. Then a quick quiz will help them solidify their
                    knowledge. When they finish, they can celebrate by creating their own 4/4 tune!</p>
                <h2 style="color: #00a39b;"><u>Sound Burst</u></h2>
                <p>WARNING: This game may potentially trigger seizures for people with photosensitive epilepsy.</p>
                <p>Does your learner love to make music? Let them explore the world of sound production through Sound
                    Burst! Perfect for learners from Pre-Kindergarten and up, Sound Burst turns your keyboard into a
                    soundboard. Press any letter key A-Z to create a unique sound and animation. To change the type of
                    sounds, press the Spacebar for a new background color and a new mood. Start playing to create your
