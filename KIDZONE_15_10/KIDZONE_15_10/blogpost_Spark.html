                <p>Help your student learn early literacy skills through engaging reading and writing games! These games
                    are perfect for early readers who want to master the basics of reading, writing, and storytelling.
                    Designed for Pre-K through 2nd graders, these stories are a fun way to read along with your child or
                    for them to read independently with the help of audio support!</p>
                <p>Here are some of our favorite early literacy games:</p>
                <h2><u style="color: #00a39b;">The Weird and Watery Animal Alphabet</u></h2>
                <p>Teach your learner about the alphabet with this beautifully illustrated digital storybook. Weird
                    Watery Alphabet takes kids on a deep dive of ocean creatures that begin with the letter A…to the
                    letter Z! Each page features a delightful illustration, a fun fact about 26 undersea animals, and
                    audio support for students reading on their own. As they read, kids will discover new facts about
                    the ocean and build familiarity with the alphabet.</p>
                <h2><u style="color: #00a39b;">Trace to the Beat</u></h2>
                <p>Help students recognize and write letters and numbers in Trace to the Beat! In this game, a dotted
                    line with an arrow guides learners as they trace a letter or number. To encourage students to try
                    their best, fun music will play every time they click and drag. But if a student’s mouse goes too
                    far out of bounds, the music will stop and they’ll have another chance to trace the letter. This
                    game helps kids with hand-eye coordination and writing out alphanumeric characters.</p>
                <h2><u style="color: #00a39b;">Molly’s Magic Adventure</u></h2>
                <p>Early readers can explore Molly’s magical world in this exciting choose-your-own-adventure story. In
                    this story, students help Molly the Unicorn find the rainbow sprinkles for her donuts. Along the
                    way, kids will practice identifying different objects and colors as Molly asks them to choose
                    between two animated options. With each choice they make, learners uncover whimsical surprises! Kids
                    will love replaying this story, finding new secrets with each new answer they choose.</p>
                <h2><u style="color: #00a39b;">Hippo and Hedgehog in Cyber-Five</u></h2>
                <p>Teach cyber safety in this animated story! Perfect for learners of any age, Cyber-Five takes readers
                    on an amusing and animated adventure to promote the five rules of online safety. At the end of the
                    story, kids will answer a few multiple-choice reading comprehension questions to reinforce what
                    they’ve learned. This story is read aloud and comes with closed captions to make it accessible to
                    more students.</p>
                <h2><u style="color: #00a39b;">Kids-Zone Storymaker</u></h2>
                <p>Inspire young storytellers by letting them write their very own book! Storymaker lets kids create
                    their own works of literature complete with illustrations, custom fonts, and a title page. To start,
                    they can use different colors and drawing tools to draw out their story in pictures. Then, they can
                    caption each image with a description of what’s happening in the story. When they’ve finished
                    writing, print out the pages to help your learner make their book!</p>
