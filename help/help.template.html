                games for grades PreK through 6. Our activities are designed by

                and inches. And adults can rest assured that kids are staying on
                track with Common Core standards. ABCya is used by over 100
                million kids each year, in countless classrooms and homes around
                the world. Our activities are categorized by grade and subject,
                and cover topics such as multiplication, parts of speech,
                typing, pattern recognition, and more. We even have games that
                are just plain fun (and safe) to play! With so much variety,
                there is sure to be something for kids at all learning levels
